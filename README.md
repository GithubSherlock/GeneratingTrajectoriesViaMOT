# Generating Trajectories via Multi-Object tracking
Student thesis: Generating Trajectories via Multi-Object tracking

Object detection and tracking are fundamental tasks for a number of applications including autonomous vehicle and video surveillance. Specifically, information about object classes, locations as well as velocity are required in the process of environment perception. The more accurate and detailed the tracking results are, the easier for the system to manage motion planning.

The multiple object tracking (MOT) problem can be seen as a data association problem where the aim is to associate detections across frames in a video sequence. To aid the data association process, trackers use various methods for modelling the motion and appearance of objects in the scene.
