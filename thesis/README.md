# Abstract

Thanks to the vigorous development of deep learning networks in recent years, nearly all tracking algorithms have enhanced their accuracy and real-time performance through feature extraction based on deep neural networks. However, aside from a few fields such as autonomous driving, research on multi-class multi-object tracking (MC-MOT) in mixed traffic environments through this method is quite limited. This paper is based on an experimental project that, following data collection, combines YOLOv8 and DeepSORT technologies to track multiple classes of objects in videos. It then explores the feasibility of projecting these trajectories onto a satellite map. Ultimately, multiple evaluation metrics are applied to assess the experimental results, and an analysis of the outputs of all sub-processes is conducted. The significance of this exploration lies in extending the application of MOT to a broader range of domains and enhancing its adaptability to the complexities of the real world.
